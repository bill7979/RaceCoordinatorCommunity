This is a random heat generator that gives you the option to pick how many lanes, drivers, rotations and the location the files are written to. It will generate all the heat files in a .json format ready to be imported into Race Coordinator. When you go to import the files make sure to select all files so that you can see those with the .json extension vs just .txt files.
